## Introduction to the Problem :worried:

<p>In the recent times it is observed that INDIA aong with Pakistan and Bangladesh, all the south-asian nations are going to face the NATURAL DISASTERS caused by  global warming, climate change due to it close proximity to the Indian Ocean . Moreover the recent floods in Pakistan , North-Eastern part of India, or eastern part of India(Odisha) faced humongous floods which eventually caused Hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed, while many public health facilities, water systems and schools have been destroyed or damaged.Similarly many people have lost their families on event of these demons of nature. 
While solving such a large scale issue is a very humoungous task to undertake which would undoubntedly require collective efforts of all humans on Earth, atleast a small step in the right direction can be taken to prevent people from losing each other.


<b>Recent Events Occured:-</b>
Almost 33 million people are displaced and many have lost their lives.

* [natural calamity](http://www.sikkimlrdm.gov.in/lrd/NaturalCalamity.html)

We cannot solve these calamity problems but atleast we can help person in crisis so we built an APP where people can find their lost members.</p>

## Problems it solves
As a result of climate change, global warming, and its proximity to the Indian Ocean, it has just come to light that INDIA, along with Pakistan and Bangladesh, would all experience [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster) like floods, landscapes, earthquakes, Volcanic eruptions in the future. Additionally, the recent floods in Pakistan, North-Eastern India, and Eastern India (Odisha) were devastating and caused the destruction of hundreds of thousands of homes as well as numerous public health facilities, water systems, and educational institutions. Many people lost their lives, were displaced, and frequently became separated from their families. For a while, they lived in fear of whether they would ever be reunited with them or whether they were still alive.

Our app serves as a beacon of hope in this situation by helping people locate loved ones who have gone missing. The individual afflicted by floods or other disasters can use this app to locate lost loved ones based on their last known location and reunite with them.

## The Idea 

Many people while still being alive, arent able to contact their family in event of these large scale disasters. The idea behind this app is thatpeople who have been rescued from the diaster affected area, their details can be uploaded on the database which then their family and loved ones can retrieve by simply uploading a photo or typing in their name.
Also another use-case can be of people marking themselves as safe,pointing out their locations in order to ease the worry of their family.

## Tagline :sparkles:

<p> Now, natural calamities canâ€™t separate u from your loved ones.Find your Lost Loved Ones. :handshake:</p>

## Key Features:key:
1. Prime Feature- Here, the app's facial recognition technology may find photos and other information about the missing person, and relaying that information to both parties for further communication or used for search  operations. 
2. Sharing the affected person's present location with a photo to volunteers, the task force, and everyone in the area helps the situation. 
3. People who want to locate their missing family members can register, upload photos, and provide other details so that anyone with information can get in touch. 
4. The "Show location of relief centre" option displays the route to the operational relief centre from the user's present position. 
5. The Disaster relief team can publish a photo of the survivor so that family members can locate their loved one. - Search People page (List of Missing Persons and Submitting a Photo of Missing Person.

```
flutter pub get
```
Build and run main.dart!

## What we learned ðŸ¤“
We are a group of developers who are open to learning and experimenting with new tech. During this hackathon we learnt -
1. Using ML models in a flutter App.
2. Usage of cloud storage with database integrations within flutter.
3. Learnt about more exciting upcoming and already existing face recognition and detection tech.  
## Problems ran Into 
1. Most ML models dont seem to work with flutter and/or are outdated.
2. Flutter firebase packages dont go well together. A loophole was dont to fix this but this is by no means a permanent solution.
3. Flutter, beacuse of being new lacks a lot of documentation on very specific topics.  
## Future Updates

1. We can provide information regarding first aid , disaster reliefs.
2. We are thinking to build a platform through which messages can be ralyed to concerned people for donation purposes.
3. NEWS ROOM - here we will try to provide updated ethical stats regarding the flood affected area.
4. We also want to add a page where preventive measures or rapid procedures / action task force will be shown as a general awareness to the people.
5. A donation window within the app can also be added where relief can be sent to the people in need quite easily.
6. Using a geolocation api, the live location of people can be tracked.
7. A help platform, where people can request aid to come their way.

## FAQ

#### What is khoj app?

It is an app which helps people to find disaster affected people just by uploading a picture of the people.

#### What are the compatible devices?

This App can be used on Android, IOS, Windows, Mac and even on Web <i>(Thanks Flutter:heart:)</i>. 
<!--
## Our Mission:fire:
<p>Hovering over various pages, reports, and news headlines allowed us to genuinely learn more in-depth about the issues/challenges faced by the people, which was one of the crucial aspects we encountered while gathering data sources for the floods or other natural tragedies. We felt quite devastated. We therefore anticipate that as technology advances, it will be able to assist a large number of individuals in crisis with 100% accuracy.

Recent Events Included: 33 million people are being displaced, and the Pakistan floods have claimed countless lives.
We made an APP so that people can find their lost family members in the very least, Even though we cannot fix these terrible catastrophic problems, we can at least assist individuals in need.</p>
